NAME
    WWW::Mail15 - Connect to Mail15 service and download messages

SYNOPSIS
      use WWW::Mail15;
      my $browser = new WWW::Mail15;
      $browser->login("foo", "bar");
      print $browser->folders;
      $browser->read_folder(0); # usually the inbox
      print $browser->get_mail(0,0)->subject;
      #get the data, and audit it
      print $browser->get_mail(0,0)->retrieve->accept;

DESCRIPTION
    Create a new "WWW::Mail15" object with "new", and then log in with your
    Mail15 username and password. This will allow you to use the "folders"
    method to look at the list of folders, "read_folder" to get messages
    list inside a folder, and "get_mail" to actually get the message data in
    form of "WWW::Mail15::Message" which supports these methods: =over 4

    "subject" gives you the subject of the email,

    "from" gives you the sender of the email,

    "retrieve" turns the email into a "Mail::Audit" object - see Mail::Audit
    for more details.

    "delete" moves it to your trash.

    Code template is shamelessly stolen from WWW::Hotmail module.
